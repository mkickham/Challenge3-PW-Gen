# Password Generator Starter Code

## Project Details
This project is for a random password generator. We were given starter code for the index.html and style.css sheets. The starter code was provided by the WashU EdX bootcamp. We then had to add a script through javascript to make the "Generate Password" button function and also meet the criteria for generating a password. This password generator first prompts the user with a question, asking what length they would like the password. They must set a password that is between 8 characters and 128. Next, it will prompt the user if they would like a special character. After that, it will prompt the user if they would like to include a number. Finally, it prompts the user if they would like an Uppercase and a Lowercase letter. The code is set-up so that it will randomize both the characters and their order while generating a password.
